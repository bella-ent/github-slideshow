HTML
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup
language for <strong>documents <u>designed</u></strong> to be displayed
in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies
such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages
such as JavaScript.
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or
from local storage and render the documents
into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure
of a web page semantically and originally included cues
for the appearance of the document.

HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.
With HTML constructs, images and other objects such
as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.
HTML provides a means to create structured documents
by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings,
paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.
HTML elements are delineated by tags, written
using angle brackets.
